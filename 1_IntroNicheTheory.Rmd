####_Willdenowia sulcata_, The "Groovy Sunreed"

Perhaps the first to recognize the role of climate in determining the geography of plants, with vegetation organised in latitudinal and elevational zones.

## Climate zones and biomes

Here is RH Whittaker's mapping of biomes against two major axes of climate variation. 

He wasn't the first to do this, but the "Whittaker plot" is one of the best known.

The biomes align reasonably well with temperature and precipitation.

## The Hierarchy of Ecology

.left-column[
**Individual organism**

**Populations** are groups of interacting individuals of the same species.

**Communities** are groups of interacting individuals or populations of different species.

**Ecosystems** are the combination of biotic communities and their physical environment.

## The Niche Concept


Typically applied at the level of the population or species, but has implications for higher order levels of the hierarchy - i.e. communities, ecosystems (including biomes or the whole biosphere).

## Take-home

>*Remote sensing is a rapidly growing field that is seen as the holy grail for mapping and monitoring biodiversity (and Essential Biodiversity Variables) at high spatial resolution from local to global scales.*

>*There are many remote sensing methods and tools, and these are constantly improving.*

>*While there are many limitations (e.g. spatial resolution), many can be addressed with modelling approaches, and are being overcome as the technology and methods improve.*

>*Remote sensing approaches must be paired with _in situ_ observations to "ground-truth" and calibrate/validate that they do reflect reality on the ground.*

>*Remote sensing can be valuable for mapping habitat variables such as climate, topography, etc that can inform inference about species distributions or other proxies for biodiversity like environmental heterogeneity or spectral diversity.*
