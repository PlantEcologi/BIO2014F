####_Willdenowia sulcata_, The "Groovy Sunreed"

Perhaps the first to recognize the role of climate in determining the geography of plants, with vegetation organised in latitudinal and elevational zones.

## Climate zones and biomes

Here is RH Whittaker's mapping of biomes against two major axes of climate variation. 

He wasn't the first to do this, but the "Whittaker plot" is one of the best known.

The biomes align reasonably well with temperature and precipitation.

## The Hierarchy of Ecology

.left-column[
**Individual organism**

**Populations** are groups of interacting individuals of the same species.

**Communities** are groups of interacting individuals or populations of different species.

**Ecosystems** are the combination of biotic communities and their physical environment.

## The Niche Concept


Typically applied at the level of the population or species, but has implications for higher order levels of the hierarchy - i.e. communities, ecosystems (including biomes or the whole biosphere).

## Take-home

>*While the idea that species have particular environmental preferences/requirements and that they play specific roles in ecosystems is as old as life itself, the formal recognition and development of definitions of the niche allows us to develop more sophisticated theory in ecology and evolution.*

>*Niche theory perhaps has its roots in early biogeographic observations about the geography of plants by Willdenow, von Humboldt and others.*

>*While the niche concept has implications for higher order levels of the ecological hierarchy (communities, ecosystems, biomes), it is typically applied at the population or species level.*
