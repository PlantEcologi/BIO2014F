### Exponential growth

`\(dN/dt = rN\)`

Population growth rate, `\(r\)`, doesn't change with population size

- i.e. no competition

.pull-right[

### Logistic growth

`\(dN/dt = rN (K – N)/K\)`

Population growth rate, `\(r\)`, gets small as the population approaches carrying capacity, `\(K\)`

- i.e. _**intraspecific competition!**_

### Experiments with _Paramecium_

&lt;br&gt;

Georgyi Frantsevitch Gause's experiments with species of the unicellular cilliate genus _Paramecium_ taught us a lot about intra- and interspecific competition.

&lt;br&gt;

He cultured them in test tubes supplied with an oatmeal medium, which promotes the growth of bacteria in the upper, oxygenated part of the test tube, and yeast in the lower, de-oxygenated part of the test tube.

Why the different outcomes between the species mixes?

#### Observation

&lt;img src="images/paramecium_together.png" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

In the panel on the **left**, growth of both species is suppressed, but _P. caudatum_ actually goes extinct!

The pair on the **right** appear to be able to coexist, albeit at lower densities than when grown alone.

]

.pull-right[

#### Explanation

**Left:** _P. caudatum_ and _P. aurelia_ both feed on bacteria, but _P. aurelia_ grows 6 times faster than _P. caudatum_, resulting in its **competitive exclusion**.

&lt;br&gt;

**Right:** While _P. caudatum_ out-competes _P. bursaria_ for bacteria, _P. bursaria_ can survive on yeast in the lower, less oxygenated part of the test tube, because it contains tiny green algae that provide it with oxygen. This is an example of **resource partitioning**.

### Resource partitioning

There are many examples in nature of species that are able to coexist in a community, because they partition their resources.

Many of these examples are from birds, such as [**Robert MacArthur's 1958 study**](http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1931600) of warblers in the genus _Dendroica_ in the conifer forests of northeastern USA. Here he concluded

&gt;_"There are differences of feeding position, behavior, and nesting date which reduce competition."_

### Competitive Exclusion

The **competitive exclusion principle** is often attributed to Gause, and sometimes called Gause's law, but there were earlier observations by Grinnell, Darwin and others, e.g.

&gt;_Two species of approximately the same food habits are not likely to remain long evenly balanced in numbers in the same region. One will crowd out the other._ - [**Grinnell 1904**](https://doi.org/10.2307/4070199)

--

&lt;br&gt;

Unequivocal examples of competitive exclusion are rare, and can only be demonstrated with experiments such as Gause's. These experiments are near-impossible for organisms with longer lifespans.

--

&lt;br&gt;

Why would we need experiments? Why would field observations not be good enough?

---

### The Ghost of Competition Past

&lt;img src="images/Connell_1980_Ghost.png" width="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

In nature, while interspecific competition may be common, where competitive exclusion has occurred it cannot be observed - only one competitor would remain.

While similar species occurring in sympatry may suggest that competitive exclusion has occurred, there are other potential explanations like dispersal limitation that prevents them accessing the same physical space.

The criteria required to demonstrate that competitive exclusion has occurred, or that species have coevolved due to competition (e.g. resource partitioning or character displacement) are onerous! - see [**Connell 1980**](http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3544421).

### The Hutchinsonian Niche

.pull-left[

&lt;br&gt;

G Evelyn Hutchinson proposed that _the niche is an n-dimensional hypervolume within which a species is **able to maintain a viable population**_ - [**Hutchinson 1957**](https://doi.org/10.1101%2Fsqb.1957.022.01.039)

&lt;br&gt;

Does the occurrence of a species at a locality mean it is able to maintain a viable population there...?

&gt; _It is a fundamental biological parameter, determined by things like the number of eggs/seeds produced, the hatching/germination success of eggs/seeds, and the success with which hatchlings/germinants survive to reproductive maturity._

&lt;br&gt;

_Growth is exponential!_

Using calculus, we can express growth as an instantaneous rate as `\(dN/dt\)`, the rate of change in number of organisms at a particular instant in time.

Since our example is an exponential function, the slope of this curve is given by  `\(dN/dt = rN\)`

### Is growth always exponential?


&lt;img src="images/Branch1975_F3.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

Resources available to individuals typically shrink as population size and density increase. Competition between individuals limits growth and reproductive output (i.e. per-capita reproductive rate ( `\(r\)` )).

### What are the implications of density-dependent growth?

Serotinous Proteaceae are well known for extreme population density fluctuations after fire.

While some of this may be exogenous, driven by external forces like climate fluctuations or variability in the fire regime, [**Bond et al 1995**](http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/11956860.1995.11682291) demonstrated that it could be endogenous, driven by internal population dynamics due to density-dependent effects.

### Density-dependence in serotinous Cape Proteaceae 

.pull-left[
Empirical datasets showed evidence for a negative impact of density-dependence on:

- recruitment (Figure 1)
- fecundity (Figure 4)

&lt;br&gt;

Notice the exogenous effect of aridity on _Protea repens_ seedling establishment at the arid inland site (Figure 1, bottom).

### Protea density-dependence 

They fed their empirical data into population models and projected population growth over multiple generations.

Note that generations and fires are synonymous, because serotinous Proteaceae mostly only recruit after fire.

Decreasing the starting population size ( `\(N_0\)` ), which would reduce the initial effect of density on population growth, increased the amplitude of population fluctuations, creating risk of total population crashes.

This effect was stronger in _P. neriifolia_, because its cone production (fecundity) was more sensitive to population density.
