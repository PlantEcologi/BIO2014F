### The Eltonian Niche

> _"what [it] is doing in its community,... its place in the **biotic** environment, its relations to food and enemies"_ - [**Elton 1927**](https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/A/bo25281897.html)

> _"used in ecology in the sense that we speak of trades or professions or jobs in a human community"_ - [**Elton 1933**](https://books.google.co.za/books/about/The_Ecology_of_Animals.html?id=OxzZAAAAMAAJ&redir_esc=y)

Focuses on the organism's role or **function** in the ecosystem, often in relation to trophic position (consumers, predators, etc) and **resource use**.

Often considers the **attributes or traits** of species that allow them to fulfill their role.

Plants have a range of nutrient-acquisition strategies that affect both their ability to compete for (or partition) nutrients and the soil environmental conditions where they are most likely to occur ([**Lambers et al. 2008**](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tree.2007.10.008)).

Sampled traits and demographic parameters (fecundity, recruitment and adult fire survival) for the 26 species from across their ranges.

Most of the variation in traits was between species, but some (e.g. leaf and seed N) showed high intraspecific variability.

Built demographic models to estimate measures of the fundamental Hutchinsonian niche for the 26 species. These were the niche optimum and niche width for each of 5 environmental variables (aridity, minimum and maximum temperature, soil fertility and fire interval) and the $r_{max}$ (which integrates across all variables).

**Environmental filtering** should select for species with the traits needed to survive in that environment, usually reducing the variation in traits.

**Biotic interactions** can have two outcomes. Competition should drive trait divergence. Conversely, a common limiting factor (e.g. a resource or shared predator) should drive convergence.

Examples?

### Traits and Community Assembly

.left-column[

Just a note that these things are complex to measure though. 

For example, limiting similarity may result in a greater range of traits, but there's a lot going on within that range too. Only species with overlapping niches should compete, so many species within the range should be competitively excluded...

## But how do we know these are the right traits?

### Traits and Community Assembly

.pull-left[
If one has a clear understanding of the system and necessary traits, you could be more specific in your predictions than just changes in trait convergence or divergence.

e.g. This example shows the need for plants to have aerenchyma to survive in inundated wetlands, because otherwise their roots would rot.

Unfortunately, it is rare to have this detailed an understanding of the biology _a priori_. It is also difficult to generalise this rule beyond wetland plants...

### Other considerations and advantages of trait-based ecology?

.pull-left[
## There are often trade-offs among traits

Leaf dry mass per unit area (LMA) predicts 
- Nitrogen content 
- photosynthetic capacity
- relative growth rate

But
- Trades off against leaf longevity

.pull-left[
## There are often trade-offs among traits

LMA correlates with environment (temp and rainfall)
- Higher LMA in hot, dry places

<br>

This also represents a trade-off in that specific traits can limit species to specific resource/habitat requirements (water, light, nutrients). i.e. these trade-offs have a direct effect on species niches!

### Traits and scaling

```{r echo = F, fig.align = 'center', out.width = '75%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Funk2017_F1.png")
```

Traits affect processes from the organism to ecosystem and should help us scale across the hierarchy or ecology [**Funk et al. 2017**](http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/brv.12275)

---

### Traits and ecosystem function

```{r echo = F, fig.align = 'center', out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Chapin1997_F1.png")
```

A focus on traits allows us to link community assembly and outcomes for ecosystem function, [**Chapin et al 1997**](http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.277.5325.500)

> "Opinions  regarding  the relative   importance   of   the   niche,   and   hence   traits,   to community dynamics fall loosely into three camps.

> - The first argues  that  trait  differences  among  individuals  are  largely irrelevant  at  the  community  level  compared  to  factors such  as  demographic  stochasticity  (e.g.  Neutral  Theory: Hubbell, 2001). 
> - The second argues that traits are relevant to  individuals,  but  the  complexity  of  biotic  and  abiotic interactions  precludes  us  from  scaling  individual  processes to the community level (e.g. Lawton, 1999). 
> - The final camp argues that traits provide a path forward to a unified theory of  community  ecology  by  providing  a  taxon-independent means  for  generalizing  the  structure  and/or  functioning of  communities  that  is  based  on  functional  traits  rather than  species  identity  (e.g. Westoby  &  Wright,  2006; McGill et al.,  2006a)."
