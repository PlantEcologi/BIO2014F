Some concepts you should make sure to know (but there may be more):
- What are _priority effects_ and how do they relate to species coexistence?
- What is the difference between _fundamental_ and _realised_ niches?
- What is the difference between _niche breadth_ and _niche overlap_?
- What are the _effect_ and _response_ components of the niche according to Contempoary Niche Theory?
- Understand why ZNGIs can be depicted in the context of niche axes in addition to population numbers as for the Lotka-Volterra competition equations.
