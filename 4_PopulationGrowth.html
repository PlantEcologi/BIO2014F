### The Hutchinsonian Niche

.pull-left[

&lt;br&gt;

G Evelyn Hutchinson proposed that _the niche is an n-dimensional hypervolume within which a species is **able to maintain a viable population**_ - [**Hutchinson 1957**](https://doi.org/10.1101%2Fsqb.1957.022.01.039)

&lt;br&gt;

Does the occurrence of a species at a locality mean it is able to maintain a viable population there...?

Consider growth of a population, starting with 2 individuals at t = 0. 
- Assume a per-capita reproductive rate, `\(r\)` = 2

&gt; **Note:** _The per-capita reproductive rate ( `\(r\)` ) is the number of reproductively mature individuals contributed per individual from one generation to the next. Population growth is positive where `\(r \geq 1\)`_.

&gt; _It is a fundamental biological parameter, determined by things like the number of eggs/seeds produced, the hatching/germination success of eggs/seeds, and the success with which hatchlings/germinants survive to reproductive maturity._

_Growth is exponential!_

Using calculus, we can express growth as an instantaneous rate as `\(dN/dt\)`, the rate of change in number of organisms at a particular instant in time.

Since our example is an exponential function, the slope of this curve is given by  `\(dN/dt = rN\)`

### Is growth always exponential?


&lt;img src="images/Branch1975_F3.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

Resources available to individuals typically shrink as population size and density increase. Competition between individuals limits growth and reproductive output.

While some of this may be exogenous, driven by external forces like climate fluctuations or variability in the fire regime, [**Bond et al 1995**](http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/11956860.1995.11682291) demonstrated that it could be endogenous, driven by internal population dynamics due to density-dependent effects.

### Density-dependence in serotinous Cape Proteaceae 

.pull-left[
Empirical datasets showed evidence for a negative impact of density-dependence on:

- recruitment (Figure 1)
- fecundity (Figure 4)

&lt;br&gt;

Notice the exogenous effect of aridity on _Protea repens_ seedling establishment at the arid inland site (Figure 1, bottom).

Note that generations and fires are synonymous, because serotinous Proteaceae mostly only recruit after fire.

Note that generations and fires are synonymous, because serotinous Proteaceae mostly only recruit after fire.

Decreasing the starting population size ( `\(N_0\)` ), which would reduce the initial effect of density on population growth, increased the amplitude of population fluctuations, creating risk of total population crashes.

This effect was stronger in _P. neriifolia_, because it had higher cone production (fecundity) and was more sensitive to population density.

&gt; No! We need estimates of their population growth rate ( `\(r\)` ).

&lt;br&gt;

We can estimate population growth rate ( `\(r\)` ) from demographic parameters that we can measure in the field (e.g. birth, death and dispersal rates) using demographic models.

### How does this relate to SDMs?

.pull-left[

We can build SDMs based on demographic models that estimate population growth across different environmental conditions.

&lt;img src="images/Schurr2012.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

These types of SDMs are often called Demographic Distribution Models (DDMs), and can tell us where species should be able to maintain a viable population!

### How does this relate to SDMs?

Interestingly, positive population growth can be maintained using very different strategies.

&lt;img src="images/protearates.jpg" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

Here seeding vs sprouting serotinous Proteaceae show classic differentiation on the `\(r\)` (invest in recruitment) vs `\(K\)` (invest in survival) life history strategy spectrum [**(Treurnicht et al. 2020)**](http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/geb.13048).

## Take-home

&gt;*If population growth were density-independent, it would be exponential...*

&gt;*Most species exhibit density-dependent population growth due to intraspecific competition and other density-dependent factors (e.g. disease transmission), thus self-regulating their population size.*

&gt;*Density-dependence creates an endogenous control on populations and has big implications for their size and stability.*

&gt;*One needs estimates of population growth rates to know whether populations can be maintained and define the environmental conditions of the Hutchinsonian niche. This can be done if you can estimate birth, death and dispersal rates.*

&gt;*Newer SDMs can include a demographic modelling component to map species distributions based on the Hutchinsonion niche.*
