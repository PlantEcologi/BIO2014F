### Relatedness

While it seems obvious now, it took a long time for people to realise that the similarity among some species that we observe is because they have descended from a common ancestor.

They were once identical, because they were once the same thing!

The degree to which they differ is a function of time, genetic variation (including mutation rates), genetic and developmental constraints, and selective pressure.

### Phylogeny and ecological similarity

**Phylogenetic signal** is the tendency for related species to resemble each other more than they resemble species drawn at random from the phylogenetic tree.

**Phylogenetic niche conservatism** is when closely related species are _more_ similar ecologically than expected based on their relatedness (i.e. given the time they've had to diverge).

### The Competition-Relatedness Hypothesis

> _"As the species of the same genus usually have, though by no means invariably, much similarity in habits and constitution, and always in structure, the struggle will generally be more severe between them, if they come into competition with each other, than between the species of distinct genera."_ - [**Darwin 1859**](https://books.apple.com/za/book/on-the-origin-of-species/id395536758)

<br>

In modern ecology, this translates as:

<br>

> Since close relatives usually have similar traits, and thus similar niches, the limiting similarity principle dictates that they should compete more strongly than distant relatives.

They found that close relatives were functionally similar and that they rarely co-occur (empty top-left corner of figures), as one would expect if close relatives competitively exclude one another.

Similar patterns have been found for many taxonomic groups all over the world, but it is difficult to exclude processes other than competition as potential drivers of the pattern.

### Relatedness and habitat filtering

As a counter to the competition-relatedness hypothesis, since close relatives should have similar traits and niches, you might expect them to be filtered into the same communities.

This sets up contrasting predictions, depending on whether competition or habitat filtering are the dominant processes...

Revisiting our rainforest example from the previous lecture, [**Kraft and Ackerly 2010**](https://doi.org/10.1890/09-1672.1) did a follow-up study looking at trait conservatism and phylogenetic relatedness in their Amazon forest plot.

They found that the range and variance of a set of key traits were smaller than expected by chance (i.e. clustered), and that the communities showed phylogenetic clustering at a range of plot sized from 5 to 100m.

### Relatedness and habitat filtering

If we consider that close relatives may not have similar traits and niches, you might expect them to be filtered into different communities.

In fact, in this case, distant relatives are likely to have converged (**convergent evolution**) to the same traits or niche preferences, leading to habitat filtering selecting for communities of distantly related species!

### Niches and Diversification

Since niches are key for the distribution and coexistence of species, it stands to reason that they should feed back to affect the diversification process?

```{r echo = F, fig.align = 'center', out.width = '60%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Foote_1997.png")
```

One proposal is that diversification should slow through time as niche space is gradually filled. This is termed density- (or diversity-) dependent diversification.

The idea has its roots in paleobiology, based on the study of fossils, but has since been explored using molecular phylogenies.

### Diversity-dependent diversification

```{r echo = F, fig.align = 'center', out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Rabosky2008.png")
```

The key notion is that the diversification rate declines through time as the number of lineages increases (and presumably niche space saturates).

While the notion that there is an ecological limit on diversification is a somewhat controversial one, there's enough evidence of a pattern that it cannot be ignored, even if we're not sure of the process. We may yet find alternative explanations...

### Traits and Community Assembly

**Environmental filtering** should select for species with the traits needed to survive in that environment, usually reducing the variation in traits.

**Biotic interactions** can have two outcomes. Competition should drive trait divergence. Conversely, a common limiting factor (e.g. a resource or shared predator) should drive convergence.

[**Kraft et al. 2009**](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1160662) explored trait means and variances in trees across a 25 Ha Amazonian forest plot - the ancestral home of Hubbell's Neutral Theory.

Trait means were non-random - e.g. panel A shows that SLA was lower than expected on ridgetops (pink) and higher than expected in valleys (turquoise).

They also found that the range of traits was smaller than null expectation.

This is strong evidence of niche-based trait filtering!

### Traits and Community Assembly

There have been quite a few tests! Here is just a small sample from plant communities.

o = overdispersion (or evenness) = trait divergence

u = underdispersion = trait convergence

<br>

Results are clearly quite mixed!!!

Unfortunately, we're not always able to make sense of the patterns and reconcile them with the expected ecological processes... but we're learning!

### Traits and Community Assembly

One issue is that these things are complex to measure! Different measures may be more or less suitable to different datasets or biotic communities, and can give different outcomes...

.left-column[
For example, limiting similarity may result in a greater range of traits, but there's a lot going on within that range too. Only species with overlapping niches should compete, so many species within the range should be competitively excluded...

## But how do we know these are the right traits?

### Traits and Community Assembly

.pull-left[
If one has a clear understanding of the system and necessary traits, you could be more specific in your predictions than just changes in trait convergence or divergence.

e.g. This example shows the need for plants to have aerenchyma to survive in inundated wetlands, because otherwise they can't get oxygen to their roots and they would rot.

Unfortunately, it is rare to have this detailed an understanding of the biology _a priori_. It is also difficult to generalise this rule beyond wetland plants...

### Other considerations and advantages of trait-based ecology?

### Traits and scaling

```{r echo = F, fig.align = 'center', out.width = '75%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Funk2017_F1.png")
```

Traits affect processes from the organism to ecosystem and should help us scale across the hierarchy or ecology, [**Funk et al. 2017**](http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/brv.12275)

---

### Traits and ecosystem function

```{r echo = F, fig.align = 'center', out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Chapin1997_F1.png")
```

A focus on traits allows us to link community assembly and outcomes for ecosystem function, [**Chapin et al 1997**](http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.277.5325.500)

### Trade-offs among traits

A trade-off occurs when one trait cannot increase without a decrease in another. This can put profound limitations on the ecology of organisms.

E.g. Leaf dry mass per unit area (LMA) positively correlates with:
- Nitrogen content 
- photosynthetic capacity
- relative growth rate

But is negatively correlated with:
- leaf longevity

### Trade-offs among traits

LMA correlates with environment (temp and rainfall)
- Higher LMA in hot, dry places

<br>

This also represents a trade-off in that specific traits can limit species to specific resource/habitat requirements (water, light, nutrients). i.e. the trade-offs in traits can have a direct effect on species niches!

### Where to for trait-based ecology and niche theory?

<br>

> _"Opinions  regarding  the relative   importance   of   the   niche,   and   hence   traits,   to community dynamics fall loosely into three camps._

> - _The first argues  that  trait  differences  among  individuals  are  largely irrelevant  at  the  community  level  compared  to  factors such  as  demographic  stochasticity  (e.g.  Neutral  Theory: Hubbell, 2001)._
> - _The second argues that traits are relevant to  individuals,  but  the  complexity  of  biotic  and  abiotic interactions  precludes  us  from  scaling  individual  processes to the community level (e.g. Lawton, 1999)._
> - _The final camp argues that traits provide a path forward to a unified theory of  community  ecology  by  providing  a  taxon-independent means  for  generalizing  the  structure  and/or  functioning of  communities  that  is  based  on  functional  traits  rather than  species  identity  (e.g. Westoby  &  Wright,  2006; McGill et al.,  2006a)."_

## Take-home

>*Traits were clearly included in early definitions of the niche by Grinnell and Elton.*

>*While some traits may be more Grinnellian (relating to environmental conditions) and other more Eltonian (relating to resource exploitation and the species functional role), they are often difficult to classify as they may be related to both.*

>*Integrating traits into niche theory requires being able to predict (a) aspects of the niche, and (b) community assembly processes, based on traits.*
  - *We're having mixed results here, but we are making progress...*

>*A focus on traits allows us to integrate across the hierarchy of ecology from the individual to whole ecosystems.*

>*A focus on traits allows us to link community assembly, ecosystem function and nature's contributions to people.*
