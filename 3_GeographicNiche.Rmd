### The Grinnellian Niche

<br>

Focused on the **abiotic** by exploring species _habitat_ based on the environmental requirements of organisms (temperature, rainfall, soils, etc).

Has largely become synonymous with species' geographic distributions.

### The Hutchinsonian Niche

.pull-left[

<br>

G Evelyn Hutchinson proposed that _the niche is an n-dimensional hypervolume within which a species is able to maintain a viable population_ - [**Hutchinson 1957**](https://doi.org/10.1101%2Fsqb.1957.022.01.039)

This both aids our ability to think about the niche, but also allows us to explicitly **quantify the niche and niche space**.

### Species Distribution Models (SDMs)

.pull-left[
Also referred to as Ecological Niche Models.

Utilise concepts proposed by Grinnell and Hutchinson to predict the geographic distribution (or range) of species.

SDMs propose that a species' distribution can be predicted based on the environmental conditions at localities where they have been observed.

The "prediction" is usually based on a statistical model that uses the known localities to estimate the probability of a species occurring across the given environmental space.

**Left:** mapped species occurrences plus spatial data for environmental variables across a particular area. 

**Centre:** a 3-dimentional volume showing species occurrences (black) in environmental space (grey). Occurrences are clearly non-random, allowing us to predict the probability of species occurrence at any point. 

**Right:** The predicted geographic distribution of the species, with dark regions representing a high probability of species occurrence and light areas a low probability.

### What are SDMs used for?

SDMs can predict the present distribution of a species if it is poorly known, but have also been used extensively to explore species' vulnerability to climate change by projecting their potential range under future climates, among other uses.

### What are SDMs used for?

Projected species distributions are used in many ways, including in conservation. Our National Screening Tool for environmental impact authorizations for developments includes modelled distributions of animals. Sites where sensitive species occur are required to do more thorough site inspection studies.

### Can you foresee any issues with SDMs?

---

### 1. Statistical models vs reality?

_Statistical models are necessarily simplifications of reality, and their predictions always come with some error (i.e. there is uncertainty)._

--

Sources of error in SDMs:

- the choice of variables included in the model 
    - have all of the most important determinants of a species distribution been included?
--
- biases in the occurrence data 
    - easy-to-access areas are usually overrepresented (e.g. near roads)
--
- quality of the occurrence and environmental data...
    - GIGO (garbage in - garbage out)
--
- the type and structure of the statistical model...
    - continuous (abundance), discrete (presence/absence), frequentist vs Bayesian, etc

--

Ideally one quantifies and reports the uncertainty for your model, but that is a topic for [**BIO3019S**](https://science.uct.ac.za/department-biological-sciences/undergraduate-study/third-year-courses)...

### 2. SDMs and the realised niche?

Hutchinson made a distinction between the _fundamental_ versus the _realised_ niche - [**Hutchinson 1957**](https://doi.org/10.1101%2Fsqb.1957.022.01.039)

- The _**fundamental niche**_ is the range of conditions (biotic and abiotic) and resources in which a species could survive and reproduce if free of interference from other species.
- The _**realised niche**_ is a subset of the fundamental niche where a species actually occurs due to interference from other species (e.g. interspecific competition). 

<br>

Which do SDMs represent? Why is this a problem?

.footnote[Answer: The realised niche, because the model is trained on where the species actually occurred. This can be a problem, because the model doesn't usually include spatial information about factors that determine the realised niche (competition, etc), so themodelled distribution is neither the fundamental nor the realised niche... ]

---

### 3. SDMs and the assumption of equilibrium?

```{r echo = F, fig.align = 'center', out.width = '70%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/brown_carnaval_niches.png")
```

A) If a species has an equilibrium distribution, it is occupying all of the potentially suitable habitats in the world (the potential niche is completely filled). 

B) If a species is in a non-equilibrium distribution, its potential niche is not fully occupied due to inaccessible habitat due to dispersal (movement) constraints: distance or barriers to dispersal, inability to recolonise habitats affected by seasonality or long-term dynamism.

Species rarely occupy their full potential niche!

### e.g.Invasive species and the assumption of equilibrium

```{r echo = F, fig.align = 'center', out.width = '70%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/tingley2014_SDM_projected.jpeg")
```

Reciprocal projections of models calibrated using data from either the invasive Australian (left) or native South American (right) occurrence of the cane toad, _Rhinella marina_, and projected into the other.

Invasive (left): predicted a broader latitudinal distribution in the native South American range than is observed

Native (right): failed to predict invasive populations in drier and cooler regions to the SE of Australia

- Why???

####Hypothesis 2

Difference in biotic interactions experienced on each continent?

>*"One possibility is that the presence of a closely related species (R. schneideri) in cooler and drier regions of Southern Brazil may be preventing R. marina from colonizing suitable environments south of its present range.* 
*...these two species hybridize..., and even low rates of interspecific hybridization can enforce stable range boundaries"*

Does the occurrence of a species at a locality mean it is able to maintain a viable population there...?

## Take-home

>*One of the most common applications of the concept of the niche is Species Distribution Modelling (also known as Ecological Niche Modelling).*

>*While SDMs can be very useful, they have many issues and assumptions that need to be taken into account.*

>*Acknowledging the issues or assumptions of SDMs can actually be very useful for learning about species and testing hypotheses.*

>_**Proviso:** There are many ways to build SDMs and it is a rapidly moving field. There are methods to address some of the issues I highlight, but they are less commonly used and since I am covering SDMs in one lecture for this course I'm not going to go there..._
