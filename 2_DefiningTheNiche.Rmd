> _"Ecology's love-hate relationship with the niche concept has been long and not
 especially pretty. Whereas some ecologists continue to see value in the concept,
 others have despaired of ever finding an expression that is both general and non-circular. Part of the problem, originating early in our science, has been that different investigators have meant different things by "niche.""_
 
Nelson G. Hairson, Jr. - _Editor's Note on [**Leibold 1995**](http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1938141)_

>_"...most [ecologists] would agree that niche is a central concept in ecology, even though we do not know exactly what it means..."_

### Central figures in defining the niche

- Joseph Grinnell | The _Grinnellian Niche_
- Charles Elton | The _Eltonian Niche_
- G Evelyn Hutchinson | The _Hutchinsonian Niche_

### The Grinnellian Niche

.pull-left[
```{r echo = F, fig.align = 'center', out.width = '85%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/grinnell_1917.png")
```

> _"An explanation of this restricted distribution is probably to be found in the close adjustment of the bird in various physiological and psychological respects to a narrow range of **environmental conditions**. The nature of these critical conditions is to be learned through an examination of the bird's habitat."_

.footnote[[**Grinnell 1917**](http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/4072271)]
]

.pull-right[
```{r echo = F, fig.align = 'center', out.width = '85%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/california_thrasher.jpg")
```

.pull-left[

### The Grinnellian Niche

<br>

Focused on the **abiotic** by exploring species _habitat_ based on the environmental requirements of organisms (temperature, rainfall, soils, etc).

Has largely become synonymous with species' geographic distributions.

]

.pull-right[
```{r echo = F, fig.align = 'center', out.width = '90%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/grinnell_1917_map.png")
```

.footnote[[**Grinnell 1917**](http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/4072271)]
]

### The Eltonian Niche

> _"what [an animal] is doing in its community,... its place in the **biotic** environment, its relations to food and enemies"_ - [**Elton 1927**](https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/A/bo25281897.html)

> _"used in ecology in the sense that we speak of trades or professions or jobs in a human community"_ - [**Elton 1933**](https://books.google.co.za/books/about/The_Ecology_of_Animals.html?id=OxzZAAAAMAAJ&redir_esc=y)

<br>

This definition focuses on the organism's role or _function_ in the ecosystem.

It often considers the traits of species that allow them to fulfill their role.

Since Charles Elton was mostly working with animals, his focus was largely on trophic position (consumers, predators, etc), but this can be expanded to plants and other life forms.
  - Generally the focus is on _resource use_.

---

### The Eltonian Niche

He used the two African rhinoceros species as an example.
.pull-left[
```{r echo = F, fig.align = 'center', out.width = '85%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/white_rhino.jpg")
```

White rhinos have a wide ("wyd") mouth (the origin of its name), for feeding on grass (a grazer).

]

.pull-right[
```{r echo = F, fig.align = 'center', out.width = '85%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/black_rhino.jpg")
```

Black rhinos have narrow pointed lips for selective feeding on the foliage of bushes (a browser).

### The Eltonian vs Grinnellian Niche

Focuses on: 

.pull-left[

- the biotic environment
- resource exploitation
- resource limitations/constraints
- species can interact with and modify these resources (i.e. they have both a _response to_ and _effect on_ the environment)

]

.pull-right[

- the abiotic environment
- environmental conditions
- environmental limitations/constraints
- mostly only considers species' _response to_ the environment

]

<br>

Note the key difference between:

- _**resources**_ (which can be exploited and altered by the species, e.g. prey or nutrient availability) and 
- _**environmental conditions**_ (are not altered by the species on ecological timescales, e.g temperature, rainfall)

---

### The Hutchinsonian Niche

.pull-left[

G Evelyn Hutchinson made a few key propositions that really expanded the utility of the niche concept in ecology.

**Firstly**, he proposed that _the niche is an n-dimensional hypervolume within which a species is able to maintain a viable population_ - [**Hutchinson 1957**](https://doi.org/10.1101%2Fsqb.1957.022.01.039)

This both aids our ability to think about the niche, but also allows us to explicitly **quantify the niche and niche space**.

```{r echo = F, fig.align = 'center', out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/treurnicht2020_hutchinson.jpg")
```

.footnote[Figure from [**Treurnicht et al. 2020**](http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/geb.13048)]
]

---

### The Hutchinsonian Niche

.pull-left[

**Secondly**, Hutchinson made a distinction between the _fundamental_ versus the _realised_ niche - [**Hutchinson 1957**](https://doi.org/10.1101%2Fsqb.1957.022.01.039)

- The _**fundamental niche**_ is the range of conditions (biotic and abiotic) and resources in which a species could survive and reproduce if free of interference from other species.
- The _**realised niche**_ is a subset of the fundamental niche where a species actually occurs due to interference from other species (e.g. interspecific competition).
