### The Hutchinsonian Niche

.pull-left[

<br>

G Evelyn Hutchinson proposed that _the niche is an n-dimensional hypervolume within which a species is **able to maintain a viable population**_ - [**Hutchinson 1957**](https://doi.org/10.1101%2Fsqb.1957.022.01.039)

<br>

Does the occurrence of a species at a locality mean it is able to maintain a viable population there...?

### It means maintaining population growth...

Consider growth of a population, starting with 2 individuals at t = 0. 
- Assume a per-capita reproductive rate, $r$ = 2

**Note:** _The per-capita reproductive rate ( $r$ ) is the number of reproductively mature individuals contributed per individual from one generation to the next. Population growth is positive where $r > 0$_.

_It is a fundamental biological parameter, determined by things like the number of eggs/seeds produced, the hatching/germination success of eggs/seeds, and the success with which hatchlings/germinants survive to reproductive maturity._

_It is the birth rate minus the death rate._

_Growth is exponential!_

Using calculus, we can express growth as an instantaneous rate as $dN/dt$, the rate of change in number of organisms at a particular instant in time.

Since our example is an exponential function, the slope of this curve is given by  $dN/dt = rN$

### Is growth always exponential?


```{r echo = F, fig.align = 'center', out.width = '65%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Scutellastra cochlear.jpeg")
```


Resources available to individuals typically shrink as population size and density increase. 

Competition between individuals limits growth and reproductive output.

### What are the implications of density-dependent growth?

Serotinous Proteaceae are well known for extreme population density fluctuations after fire.

While some of this may be exogenous, driven by external forces like climate fluctuations or variability in the fire regime, [**Bond et al 1995**](http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/11956860.1995.11682291) demonstrated that it could be endogenous, driven by internal population dynamics due to density-dependent effects.

### Density-dependence in serotinous Cape Proteaceae

Empirical datasets showed evidence for a negative impact of density-dependence on:

- recruitment (Figure 1)
- fecundity (Figure 4)

<br>

Notice the exogenous effect of aridity on _Protea repens_ seedling establishment at the arid inland site (Figure 1, bottom).

### Protea density-dependence 

They fed their empirical data into demographic models and projected population growth over multiple generations.

Note that generations and fires are synonymous, because serotinous Proteaceae mostly only recruit after fire.

Note that generations and fires are synonymous, because serotinous Proteaceae mostly only recruit after fire.

Decreasing the starting population size ( $N_0$ ), which would reduce the initial effect of density on population growth, increased the amplitude of population fluctuations, creating risk of total population crashes.

This effect was stronger in _P. neriifolia_, because it had higher cone production (fecundity) and was more sensitive to population density.

### Disease or parasites

As population density increases, so does the probability of transmission.

### Predation

As the prey population density increases, so does the predator population. Eventually, the high number of predators causes the prey population to crash. This causes the predator population to crash, which allows the prey population to recover. This cycle continues, creating a predator-prey cycle.

There are many variations and elaborations of this theme...

### Accumulation of waste products

If the wastes can't be recycled fast enough, they can become toxic to the population. This is a common problem in aquaculture, where fish are kept in high densities and the water becomes polluted with their waste products.

Another example is fermentation in the making of wine. Alcohol is a waste product created by the yeast. As the yeast population grows, alcohol builds up, but it is toxic to the yeast. Above 13% alcohol content, the yeast population is doomed, which is why no naturally fermented wine contains more than 13% alcohol. To make stronger alcoholic beverages, they must be distilled out of wine or beer.

### What about positive density-dependence? 

--

Often called Allee effects after ecologist W.C. Allee, who described the phenomenon in the context of cooperative feeding in social insects ([**Allee 1931**](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-7998.1931.tb02175.x)).

## Take-home

>*If population growth were density-independent, it would be exponential...*

>*Most species exhibit density-dependent population growth due to intraspecific competition and other density-dependent factors (e.g. disease transmission), thus self-regulating their population size.*

>*Density-dependence creates an endogenous control on populations and has big implications for their size and stability.*

>*There are other factors that can cause negative density dependence (predation, disease, etc) and some that can cause positive density dependence (also known as Allee effects).*

>*One needs estimates of population growth rates to know whether populations can be maintained and define the environmental conditions of the Hutchinsonian niche. This can be done if you can estimate birth, death and dispersal rates.*
